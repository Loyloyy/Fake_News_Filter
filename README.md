# Fake News Filter

### Motivation
My goal for this project includes the following
- To maximise my time at home during my country's lockdown (circuit breaker)
- Widen my knowledge on using classification  with supervised machine learning algorithms
- Learn more about natural language processing
- Try if it is possible to combine 2 machine learning models, otherwise known as ensemble learning.

### Synopsis
In recent years, there has been an upsurge in fake news content due to multiple reasons. Some people do it to fulfil their sensational nature but at the same time, some fake news are also created for research purposes. Whichever the purpose is, fake news has become a nuisance in society today, leading people to spread falsified information.

The aim of this project will be to utilise a bag of words model to encode the words with an integer so as to associate words with whether the content is real or fake. This bag of words model will be integrated together with a supervised machine learning algorithm at the end to help achieve better accuracy.
